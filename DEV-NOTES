Miscellaneous notes which may help anybody looking at the source code:

* Magnitudes are represented "backwards" internally, as 2.5*log10(flux).
  This is bizarre and confusing, and should be fixed.  It is related
  to the strange terminology in the output files, in that these quantities
  were flux once (a very long time ago, during the initial design / 
  experimentation phase).  I should have changed it back then when it
  would have been easier...

* Values of -999 are (ab)used widely to represent undefined values
  internally.  This should be changed to use the flags, which were added
  later.
  
* Unfortunately, zero is used in the input files for undefined values
  rather than NaNs, which makes the condition difficult to detect,
  especially for difference imaging where zero is a perfectly valid
  input value.

* There is a lot of repetition in readfits.c.  I hope to tidy it up some
  day.
